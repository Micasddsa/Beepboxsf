Welcome to the Beepbox Soundfont REFORMATTED!

This is a Remaster + Update of my old Beepbox SF2.

FAQ

Q: will you post this in Musical Artifacts.

A: No.

Q: Will you include *Insert Instrument Preset's Name*

A: All instrument presets will be sampled.

Q: Can you add this sound i made in beepbox in the SF?

A: Make a Request in Issues. it will be added to a addon sf2 not to clutter the main sf2.

Q: Is this a genesis/megadrive soundfont? since Beepbox uses FM?

A: No, some presets might use FM but some use Pulse width and other stuff, it is not a replacement Megadrive SF.

Q: Do i have to give credit?

A: no. since i didn't make the sounds, you can use them without credit. but if you want to share, share this repository so they can get latest updates and stuff.
